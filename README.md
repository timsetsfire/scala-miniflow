# scala-miniflow

Came across this during my Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree and thought it was very cool.
The original library, MiniFlow, was a neural network library written from scratch (in Python)
that behaves much like TensorFlow, Google's deep learning library.

This is just a port of MiniFlow to Scala
