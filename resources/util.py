def topological_sort(feed_dict):
    """
    Sort generic nodes in topological order using Kahn's Algorithm.

    Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of
    vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the
    ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

    For example, a topological sorting of the following graph is “5 4 2 3 1 0?.
    There can be more than one topological sorting for a graph. For example, another
    topological sorting of the following graph is “4 5 2 0 3 1″. The first vertex
    in topological sorting is always a vertex with in-degree as 0 (a vertex with no in-coming edges).

    `feed_dict`: A dictionary where the key is a `Input` node and the value is
    the respective value feed to that node.

    Returns a list of sorted nodes.
